<h2>Macbeth</h2>
<p id="p1">Macbeth,a brave lord of the king of Scotland,Duncan,once while returning from a victorious battle
along with a companion Banquo happened to meet three witches who made three predictions which became a turning
point in Macbeth's life. When one of the predictions became true, Macbeth along with his cunning wife killed the
king cruelly to make the second prediction true. But even after becoming the king Macbeth could not find happiness
and was always haunted by the third prediction. In order to make false the third prediction he attempted many
murders. He again met the three witches who made another three predictions this time and everything went according
 to that and finally Macbeth was killed and Malcolm the son of Banquo became the king of Scotland.
